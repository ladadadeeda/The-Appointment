#### Description: The appointment countdown for your bigday! It's required user to input the appointment then countdown to that day and alarm when the day is come.

I quit my 7 years job of Logistics engineer to learn programming start with Zero
and I hope "I will become a programmer soon."
By the way, my budget is can spend for only a year.
So, I decide to create a countdown web for countdown my time with the rest of budget. (So sad)

TODO : The Appointment Project
I use the index.html for create a web page in 3 parts
1.Appointment form :
The Appointment form is required to input an appointment title & date
for the date you can type or select by pick up in calendar.
the Appointment form have an input validation. if user do not input title or date it will alert warning.
when the user input both title & date then click save it will alert status
2.Countdown display : it's display title as input & countdown by days hours minutes and seconds.
3.Alarm display when the day come:
And I create Script.js for build a function to calculate a rest time to countdown & display the result.
and keep the data in Local Storage. whenever user refresh the webpage, it still show the old data.

I also use Sweetalert2 for modify alert pop-up and google font to make website look clean.
and decorate website by style.css

Hope you enjoy the Appointment!
